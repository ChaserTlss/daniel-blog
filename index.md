I start my gap year at September 2022, and got a offer from Fanshawe College to have a study.
I arrived London.ON at April with my cat. The most interesting thing in my life is that I became a
programmer in 2016, which I absolutely love.

## Work Experience

- In 2016, I started working at SIMCOM WIRELESS SOLUTIONS in Shanghai. During my time there, I gained
  extensive knowledge of Linux and Android, and I began working in the embedded systems field as a Linux driver engineer.

- In 2018, I joined SPEADTRUM where I developed numerous USB2.0/3.0 drivers for WIFI/BT. Additionally, I
  started learning about ARM architecture and assembly programming.

- In 2020, I became a part of a startup called SCALEFLUX. The company specializes in business SSD controllers,
  specifically ARM A55 and data compression. I actively contributed to the early software development and chip
  verification of their third-generation products. After completing the initial version of the garbage
  collection and wear-leveling system, I decided to move on.

- In 2021, I joined another startup called VASTAI TECHNOLOGIES. Here, I participated in the development of AI
  accelerator cards and was responsible for the complete PCIE module. This involved developing drivers for the
  host system and firmware for the PCIE controller on the MIPS chip.

## Why Do I Blog?

I wrote some posts between 2022/10 - 2023/4, before starting my course at fanshawe in chinese. Those posts is conclusions of my past
work experience. __YES__, I need to improve my English skill. I think translating them into English is a good way to practice my English
writing skills.
